    <p>The purpose of this ranklist app is twofold:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As a gamification system to push the entire ~21 NUS students currently enrolled in Steven's CS3233 module to work as hard as they can...</li>
        <li>
        As a testing platform for Steven to self-learn Laravel framework, to be subsequently taught to Steven's CS3226 students :)

        Occasionally, we may open problem D (or even E) which is (are) the easier form of problem A/B/C. We give bonus 0.5% for top 3 in each mini contest. We use strict binary grading <i>(Accepted or not Accepted: Wrong Answer, Time Limit, Memory Limit, Runtime Error, etc)</i> for our contests.

        <pre>
        Scoring scheme:
        0% = not AC in the actual mini contest and not attempted after one more week.
        1% = managed to solve problem B during mini contest itself or before deadline.
        There is no additional marks for solving problem C at home (for CS3233R students).

26. caption - Write small notes after table. Differentiated by purpose from headings
27,28. q, h6 - for writing a really nice quotation as part of the design.

32. pre - a lazy way out to save time instead of using css code to create another order list when simple next line using space is sufficient.

Different html tags for text are used in help file to demonstrate the difference of each tag.
